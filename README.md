ICP PROJECT INDIVIDUAL PROJECT 2022

This project is intended to help a user who has a start city and stop city, to find an optimal flight from a database of airports, routes and airline CSV files. 
It uses an iterative depth-first search approach to find an optimal flight based on the number of flight stops. 
The programme also returns a minimum of five other possible flight combinations. 
The programme has a total of six classes, but the HAVERSINE OPTIMIZER class is subject to review.
When up and running, the HAVERSINE OPTIMIZER can be combined with the flight node class, to get the total distance covered by a flight as an attribute of that flight. 
Haversine Distance can serve as the basis of comparison in the flight matches priority queue.


The programme java documentation is as follows:
